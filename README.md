# Linux Server Automation Toolkit

The Linux Server Automation Toolkit is a Bash-based project designed to
simplify and automate common Linux system administration tasks. Instead of
manually executing multiple commands, this toolkit provides an interactive
menu that allows users to perform essential server management operations
quickly and efficiently.

The toolkit automates tasks such as updating and upgrading the operating
system, installing developer tools, Docker, Nginx, and AWS CLI, configuring
the firewall, enabling SSH, creating developer users, checking system health,
and generating detailed system reports. These features help reduce repetitive
manual work and improve productivity.

The project follows a modular architecture, where each administrative task is
implemented as a separate Bash script. This design makes the toolkit easy to
maintain, extend, and customize without affecting the rest of the project.

This project was developed to strengthen practical Linux system administration
and Bash scripting skills while demonstrating automation techniques commonly
used in real-world server environments. It serves as both a learning resource
and a foundation for building more advanced DevOps and infrastructure
automation projects.
